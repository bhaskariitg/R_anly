In Titanic dataset, I used rpart package instead of Random Forest. Decision tree instead of Random Forest beacuse the interpretability of rpart is better tahn of Random Forest. Accuracy that comes through rpart is less than what we get when we use Random Forest. so i used rpart so that i can understsnd the results easily.
